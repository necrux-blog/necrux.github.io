My name is Wes I do Linuxy stuff for work. I started this blog years ago while I was a junior administrator at Rackspace but I would love you revisit the project! I have recently moved the blog from a self-hosted Wordpress installation to Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Hopefully I can start blogging again for myself and others!

What can we expect from this site?
======
I still consider myself relatively new to the world of Linux, but I am very passionate about the work and I am always eager to grow and share my knowledge. This site is a notebook of sorts where I plan to document things I find interesting.

I also plan to discuss issues that I find are common conversation topics with other techs. In this way the site will serve as a conversation aid as well as a quick reference after the fact.

Hopefully other people will find the site helpful too!

What’s with the website name?
======
Necrux (nec·rux) is a portmanteau of “necromancer” and “Tux.” I believe that the idea of a penguin bringing Linux servers back from the dead perfectly embodies what it means to be a Linux administrator.
