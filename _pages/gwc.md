[Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) is a non-profit with the goal of helping women and other under-represented groups close the gender gap in tech. I love the orginzation and their mission and am currently working to become a Girls Who Code facilitator at my daughter's school. As I get more involved I will post updates here!
